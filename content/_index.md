    title: Frequently Asked <span>Questions</span>
    faq:
        - question: How long does a security risk assessment take?
          answer: Most assessments are completed within 2–3 weeks, depending on scope and responsiveness.
        - question: Do you offer one-time projects or only ongoing support?
          answer: We offer both. Many clients start with a standalone risk assessment and expand into ongoing services.
        - question: Can we use our existing tools and platforms?
          answer: Yes. We integrate with your existing environment and make recommendations based on what’s best — not what we’re trying to sell.
        - question: What industries do you support beyond healthcare?
          answer: We’re built for regulated industries — including finance, legal, and tech — but have particular expertise in healthcare environments.
