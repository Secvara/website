    title: Become <span>SECURE Aware</span>
    price: "From $7,500 (one‑time)"
    details: >-
        SECURE Aware is a one‑time Security Risk Assessment (SRA) that gives you a clear baseline of risk and compliance. We evaluate your organization against NIST CSF, then crosswalk to all compliance requirements unique to your organization. <br><br>

        From there, we identify the most important gaps and deliver a prioritized roadmap your team can act on. It’s the fastest way to get clarity and the first step toward building a right‑sized security program. <br><br>

        This is the beginning of your security journey and our partnership.

        steps:
            - We start with a risk assessment: Understand where your vulnerabilities are — and what matters most to fix.
            - We act as your embedded team: From compliance questions to incident prep, we operate as part of your organization.
            - We adapt as you grow: Security isn’t static. Whether you’re onboarding vendors, scaling infrastructure, or navigating change — we scale with you.

##### FAQs

faqs_section:
    title: Frequently Asked <span>Questions</span>
    faq:
        - question: How long does a security risk assessment take?
          answer: Most assessments are completed within 2–3 weeks, depending on scope and responsiveness.
        - question: Do you offer one-time projects or only ongoing support?
          answer: We offer both. Many clients start with a standalone risk assessment and expand into ongoing services.
        - question: Can we use our existing tools and platforms?
          answer: Yes. We integrate with your existing environment and make recommendations based on what’s best — not what we’re trying to sell.
        - question: What industries do you support beyond healthcare?
          answer: We’re built for regulated industries — including finance, legal, and tech — but have particular expertise in healthcare environments.
        - question: Do you replace our IT team or tools?
          answer: No. We partner with your existing teams and platforms, adding specialized security leadership and execution only where it adds clear value.
        - question: How do you handle HIPAA, SOC 2, or PCI?
          answer: We map to your frameworks as part of the program and prepare you for audits in Pillars and Spire, with evidence, checklists, and readiness support.
