## Not Just a Security Vendor — Your Embedded Security Team

<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->

<!-- Center-aligned or two-column layout. Consider icon-based visual beside the paragraph. Include warm, cultural tone that reflects camaraderie, team energy, and a reimagined security services experience. -->

We partner with organizations who take their security seriously — those navigating HIPAA, vendor scrutiny, regulatory audits, or rising ransomware threats.

But we’re not just consultants. We’re a new kind of security team — one that blends deep expertise with a sense of camaraderie, flexibility, and real partnership. We reimagine what it feels like to work with a cybersecurity firm: no silos, no handoffs, just a team that fits your world and scales with your needs.

Whether you're scaling, merging, or modernizing, we help you stay secure without slowing down.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- FAQ SECTION -->

<!-- Use toggle/accordion components for interactivity if supported by site framework. Otherwise, plain Q&A layout. -->

**How long does a security risk assessment take?**
Most assessments are completed within 2–3 weeks, depending on scope and responsiveness.

**Do you offer one-time projects or only ongoing support?**
We offer both. Many clients start with a standalone risk assessment and expand into ongoing services.

**Can we use our existing tools and platforms?**
Yes. We integrate with your existing environment and make recommendations based on what’s best — not what we’re trying to sell.

**What industries do you support beyond healthcare?**
We’re built for regulated industries — including finance, legal, and tech — but have particular expertise in healthcare environments.
