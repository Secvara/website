# SECURE Aware  
*One-Time Assessment Engagement*  

The **SECURE Aware** package is a standalone Security Risk Assessment (SRA). It is designed for organizations that want immediate visibility into their risks and compliance gaps without committing to an ongoing program.  

This engagement delivers a prioritized roadmap of risks and quick wins, serving as both a compliance checkpoint and a launchpad for future security maturity.

## Objectives
- Provide a one-time baseline of your security and compliance posture.  
- Identify critical risks across people, processes, and technology.  
- Deliver a prioritized roadmap of recommendations.  
- Support HIPAA and NIST CSF alignment for regulated industries.  
- Serve as the first step toward an ongoing security program.
